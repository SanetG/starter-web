PROBLEM:
THE QUALITY OF THE ORCHESTRA IS DETERIORATING

SOLUTIONS:
•	AUDITIONS FOR NEW MEMBERS MUST BE RE-IMPLEMENTED AND A MINIMUM STANDARD SET.
•	THE LESS COMPETENT PLAYERS MUST MOVE TO THE BACK OR MIDDLE OF SECTIONS AND NOT OCCUPY THE FRONT.
•	THE CONDUCTOR AND SECTION LEADERS SHOULD BE STRICT ABOUT WRONG BOWINGS AND INTONATION.
•	WHEN IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT A MUSICIAN PLAYING A SOLO PART FOR A CONCERT CANNOT COPE WITH THE MUSIC, AN ALTERNATIVE PLAYER HAS TO BE FOUND. 
•	GIVE THE COMPETENT/MORE AMBITIOUS MUSICIANS CHALLENGES ELSE THEY WILL LEAVE THE ORCHESTRA. 
•	WHEN A MEMBER HAS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE REPERTOIRE SELECTED BY THE COMMITTEE, INSTEAD OF BROADCASTING IT ON WHATSAPP, RATHER DISCUSS AND RESOLVE IT PRIVATELY WITH THE COMMITTEE.
